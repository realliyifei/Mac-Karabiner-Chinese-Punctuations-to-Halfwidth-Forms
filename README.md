# Mac Karabiner Chinese Punctuations to Halfwidth Forms

When using Chinese in markdown and code, to speed the format switch of the halfwidth/fullwidth input, we can map each inputting punctuation to its halfwidth form by pressing function key `fn`.

当在markdown或者code中运用中文时，为了更快地转换半角/全角（港台：半形/全形）的符号输入，我们可以通过同时按着`fn`键把对应正在输入的符号变为半角形式。

Notes: If you are a user of other fullwidth langauges (Japanese, Korean, etc.), you may need to modify both the `json` and `shell script` files for your need.

## List of All Mapped Keys（映射的个键列表）:

`fn` key + 

- `，` -> `,`
- `。` -> `.`
- `；` -> `;`
- `：` -> `:`
- `‘` -> `'`
- `“` -> `"`
- `”` -> `"`
- `·` -> `` ` ``
- `～` -> `~`
- `！` -> `!` 
- `？` -> `?`
- `（` -> `(`
- `）` -> `)`
- `【` -> `[`
- `】` -> `]`
- `「` -> `{`
- `」` -> `}`
- `《` -> `<`
- `》` -> `>`
- `¥` -> `$` 
- `……` -> `^`
- `——` -> `_`
- `、` -> `\`
- `｜` -> `|`

Notes: in the case of the multi-key values, we should press *all* the usual keys plus the `fn` key. For instance, when mapping `……` to `^`, we should press  `shift` + `fn` + `6`.

## Limitations

The mechanism of this script is to copy the corrosponding punucation to the clipboard and then paste to the foremost app. Therefore, **the clipboard history would be a bit messed up**. 

## Why don't we use text-replacement functions? 

There are lots of fancy text-replacement tools such as MacOS bulit-in keyboard text-replacement and Alfred 4 script.

However, for the markdown and coding scenes of fullwidth langauges, the just-in-time (JIT) halfwidth conversion is more efficient and intuitive. By using Karabiner, we can type the halfwidth punctuations just by holding a hotkey and then it would switch back to fullwidth input automatically and immediately, instead of typing a verbose replacement string each time.
